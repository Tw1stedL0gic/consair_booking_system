# How to demo server_prototype

Open two terminals and go to src/.

Open the erlang shell in both terminals using erl.

Compile the server_prototype module using c(server_prototype)..

Choose one terminal to be server and one to be client.

## Terminal

Run server_prototype:start_servet(PORT)..

PORT: Port number you want to use. 
Ex: 33333.

The server is now ready to print to terminal and respond to client. 

The server will wait for a connection and spawn a process to deal with each seperate connection. It will then receive a message and send back an applicable answer according to this table:
	
"Hello" -> "Hello";
"Foo" -> "Bar";
"Ipsum" -> "Lorem";	
<<1, 2, 3>> -> "One, Two, Three";
_ -> "I didn't understand that"

There is no way to close the server using commands yet, so just kill the process with ^G, K N (kill job N), S (start new shell), and C N (connect to job N). 

## Client

Run server_prototype:start_client(IP, PORT, MESSAGE)..

IP: The IP you want to use. When using two terminals on the same computer use "localhost" (including the quotation marks)
Ex: 123.456.789.910 or "localhost"

PORT: Port number you want to use. 
Ex: 33333.

MESSAGE: A list of messages to send. This list should only include bit strings or regular string (as they can be considered bit strings).
Ex: ["Hello", "World", <<"Foo">>, <<"Bar">>, <<1,2,3>>, <<1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10>>]

When this is run, it will spawn a process for each message. The process will wait a random amount of time, then send the message. It will then recieve a message from the server and the connection is terminated.
