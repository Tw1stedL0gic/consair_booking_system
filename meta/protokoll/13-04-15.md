## Minutes

We discussed what to do for our projekt.
We came up with three main ideas:

 1. Airport Booking
      An array of flights flying to certain places
      Simulated passengers booking concurrently over the internet and at the airport
      Some focus on disaster-proofing contingency planning
 2. Stock Trader
      Monitoring stocks
      Calculates, verifies and trades
      One process for each calculation
      A program that keeps your favorite stocks
 3. Firechat Simulation
      P2P communication
      Simulated devices
      Communication finding the shortest path
      Pathfinding 
 4. Network encryption

Lucas voiced concern that he wanted to do network encryption. 
Oscar was split 50/50 between network encryption and airport booking.
Carl and Wenting were excited about Airport booking.
Andreas was up for anything, wants to do something visual.
